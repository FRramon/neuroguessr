    "name": "Medulla",
    "structure": [
      "Most caudal portion of the brainstem, continuous with the spinal cord",
      "Contains vital autonomic centers including respiratory and cardiovascular control nuclei",
      "Houses cranial nerve nuclei V (spinal trigeminal), VI (abducens), IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), XI (accessory), and XII (hypoglossal)",
      "Key anatomical landmarks include the pyramids, olive, and fourth ventricle floor"

    "function": [
      "Regulates critical autonomic functions including breathing rhythm, heart rate, and blood pressure",
      "Controls reflexive actions such as swallowing, coughing, vomiting, and sneezing",
      "Serves as the decussation point for major motor and sensory pathways",
      "Damage can be life-threatening due to disruption of vital respiratory and cardiovascular functions"

    "name": "Pons",
    "structure": [
      "Middle portion of the brainstem located between the midbrain and medulla",

      "Contains cranial nerve nuclei V (trigeminal), VI (abducens), VII (facial), and VIII (vestibulocochlear)",
      "Divided into ventral (basilar) pons and dorsal pontine tegmentum"
    ],
    "function": [
      "Serves as a major conduit for information between the cerebrum and cerebellum via the middle cerebellar peduncles",
      "Contains pneumotaxic and apneustic centers that help regulate respiratory patterns",
      "Participates in sleep cycle regulation through reticular formation nuclei",
      "Mediates facial sensation, facial expressions, eye movements, hearing, and balance"

    "function": [
      "Primary output pathway from the cerebellum to the thalamus and cerebral cortex",
      "Carries cerebellar influence to motor and premotor cortical areas via thalamic relay",

      "Contains cerebral peduncles, substantia nigra, and red nucleus in ventral regions",
      "Houses cranial nerve nuclei III (oculomotor) and IV (trochlear)"
    ],
    "function": [
      "Processes visual and auditory information through the superior and inferior colliculi",
      "Mediates pupillary light reflexes and extraocular eye movements",
